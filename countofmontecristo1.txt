On the 24th of February, 1815, the look-out at Notre-Dame de la Gardesignalled the three-master, the Pharaon from Smyrna, Trieste, andNaples.
As usual, a pilot put off immediately, and rounding the Chateau d'If, got on board the vessel between Cape Morgion and Rion island.
Immediately, and according to custom, the ramparts of Fort Saint-Jeanwere covered with spectators; it is always an event at Marseilles for aship to come into port, especially when this ship, like the Pharaon, hasbeen built, rigged, and laden at the old Phocee docks, and belongs to anowner of the city.
The ship drew on and had safely passed the strait, which some volcanicshock has made between the Calasareigne and Jaros islands; had doubledPomegue, and approached the harbor under topsails, jib, and spanker, butso slowly and sedately that the idlers, with that instinct which isthe forerunner of evil, asked one another what misfortune could havehappened on board. However, those experienced in navigation saw plainlythat if any accident had occurred, it was not to the vessel herself, for she bore down with all the evidence of being skilfully handled, theanchor a-cockbill, the jib-boom guys already eased off, and standing bythe side of the pilot, who was steering the Pharaon towards the narrowentrance of the inner port, was a young man, who, with activity andvigilant eye, watched every motion of the ship, and repeated eachdirection of the pilot.
