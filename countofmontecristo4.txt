The order was executed as promptly as it would have been on board aman-of-war.
"Let go--and clue up!" At this last command all the sails were lowered, and the vessel moved almost imperceptibly onwards.
"Now, if you will come on board, M. Morrel, " said Dantes, observing theowner's impatience, "here is your supercargo, M. Danglars, coming out ofhis cabin, who will furnish you with every particular. As for me, I mustlook after the anchoring, and dress the ship in mourning. "
The owner did not wait for a second invitation. He seized a rope whichDantes flung to him, and with an activity that would have done credit toa sailor, climbed up the side of the ship, while the young man, goingto his task, left the conversation to Danglars, who now came towardsthe owner. He was a man of twenty-five or twenty-six years of age, ofunprepossessing countenance, obsequious to his superiors, insolent tohis subordinates; and this, in addition to his position as responsibleagent on board, which is always obnoxious to the sailors, made him asmuch disliked by the crew as Edmond Dantes was beloved by them.
"Well, M. Morrel, " said Danglars, "you have heard of the misfortune thathas befallen us?"
"Yes--yes: poor Captain Leclere! He was a brave and an honest man. "
"And a first-rate seaman, one who had seen long and honorable service, as became a man charged with the interests of a house so important asthat of Morrel & Son, " replied Danglars.
"But, " replied the owner, glancing after Dantes, who was watching theanchoring of his vessel, "it seems to me that a sailor needs not be soold as you say, Danglars, to understand his business, for our friendEdmond seems to understand it thoroughly, and not to require instructionfrom any one. "
